- How does an Interest get sent?
- How is an Interest stored/cached by ccnd?
- How is data sent back to the requester?
- What happens when Interest packets do not reach node B? Where is the break/data loss? 
- What happens when data is not transmitted successfully the first time? How much of the data is received?

- What timeout / retry timers are involved in the process of Interest requests? - How does ccnd cache/store interest requests? What about data replies? How long is it stored?

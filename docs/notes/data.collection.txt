Data to collect from each scenario:
- How many times was the requested data received?
- How many times was the data received correctly?
- How long did it take to receive the data (from the time Interest was sent)?
note: assume no data segmentation (future work?) - this allow to match Interest to Data received without worrying about segment complexity at the moment.
- What is the success rate per Interest? ( # times data received correctly / # of Interests sent) based on fixed number of interests sent per scenario
note: can plot success rate over number of trials?

Others to consider:
- Does the success rate increase as the Interest timeout is increased? ( Interests should be cached longer, is this possible without changing core ccnd?)
- Does the success rate increase as the retry timeout is increased? (could give more time for relay nodes to come into proximity or links to come back up)
- How many interests were sent before the data was received? (fixed for now, but could keep it open instead))

-no structure in BOND (smart flooding?)
-instead, consider something more structure
-- communities?
-- some regular order moving between nodes, some order of guarantee



assume that /parc , /att is unique and enforced somehow.
some sort of security chain or root CA that everyone trusts?

storage is cheap
- DTN has different ideas of importance of data


next meeting
-tuesday 13.00




look at code, compile and see what can be run

focus on:
1. how to propagate, forward data for interests and data packets
2. caching
3. routing protocols for DTNs. start with assuming disruption in connectivity (then look at large of delays, performance, mobility) 

- no naming, namespace structure focus
- no focus on security for now

look through proposal draft and make sure it covers all


scenarios assume no definite path from end to end:
- simplest 
- complexity dictated not by size only but my routing/mobility patterns (find out based on the simplest)

consumer --       relay -------- source ( /foo )
	  t1 (link)         t2 (link)

all are normal ccnx  nodes
consumer sends interest in /foo.


t1 and t2 arent always available.

assume CCNx over UDP
simple 1K data packet


how long are the links available? how long of a disconnection we can afford? where it starts? how can it be avoided?
- kill physical interface (physical link) - not as important as others
- iptables to simulate the ports go down for a certain period (CCNx face goes down, trigger a strategy change)




focus on forwarding, tweaking the strategy layer?  
not so much routing


do we need some sort of ACK that the Interest was propagated or not? it may affect decisions on re-expressing Interest or changing strategy?


logging problems? how to log output?


** Use java code for now?

ccnd to run
then ccnput
and ccnget

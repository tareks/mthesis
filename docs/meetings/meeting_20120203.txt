Followup Items:
- Complete the Interest/CO code and pushed to github. (done)
- Send initial report outline for feedback on contents. (done)
- Document setup and how ccnd handles interest and data responses plus
any other observations (to decide what to expect from scenarios and if
need to redesign).
- Document scenarios to be used in the experiment.
- Find out when would the thesis defense be. What to do if I can't
make it by June? Is there another 'batch' following that?

Discussion:
- report outline changes.
- code changes and access to github.
- investigation results so far.
-- number of interest and content packets.
-- timing and frequency.
- scenario modification and documentation.
- using haggle to test scenarios. 
- Frederik uses CCND_DEBUG=63 for everything.


Action Items:
- Possible to specify Interest lifetime during creation through API?
- put docs up on github as well
- finish working on interest/CO and scenario documentation
-- specifics to include?
- start haggle tests
- investigate if javasrc is completely separate?
- how to find out how data packets are sent over the network?
- Create log files for later analysis
-- try getting data object that doesnt exist.
--- when interests arrive from application and when sent out?
--- when ccnd expects interests?

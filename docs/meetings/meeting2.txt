evaluate NDN in DTN/ON
goal: does NDN work in such an environment
if not, what doesnt? what needs to be fixed?

simple scenario:

x ---------- z (moving) -------------- y

ppl "claim" that it should work, but noone tried it?

NDN followup on CCNx

use CCNx prototype to implement on a testbed that fredrik designed for early haggle phases?
-- java implementation
30-40 nodes, performance problems?


what are problems? with integration? design? operation?
what other experiments to run? what params to use?


1) read papers on background
2) NDN intro, testbed, learn tools
3) write weekly 
4) keep log of experiments 
-- settings
-- expected
-- actual
-- catalog results/logs


review every 2 weeks?


Action plan:

- read papers
- setup wiki
-- 
- get latest ccnx code and get something running
- setup meeting for haggle


Time Plan:





next meeting:

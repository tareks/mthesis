Agenda:
- haggle questions:
Application tag - does the app have to be exactly the same on each node? ie. will need to run 2 threads on each node to send/receive (ie. cant have separate get/put clients)
Warmup - 5 seconds?
Logging - where does that go? System.out.println okay?
How long do things run? until end of timeline or program exit?

Discussion:
warmup - not needed
15 seconds + 15 seconds then warmap then app starts
frederik will change application to specify which program each node uses
- when to do the routing ccndc stuff? - there's a config file? we can distribute that config file on a per node basis
http://www.ccnx.org/releases/latest/csrc/libexec/ccnd.conf.sample
-- use UDP for ccnx communication
to terminate scenario, all links must be down
- by default all inks are down, links are only up between intervals
- time is in seconds, can we change trace file to use ms?

logging: write to files under /home/.Haggle
also ccnd output in config file or redirect

parse logs for final output from ccnd logs

# of experiments to run should 15 times or 20 instead of 5.

Action Items:
- Possible to specify Interest lifetime during creation through API?
- finish working on interest/CO and scenario documentation
-- specifics to include?
- investigate if javasrc is completely separate?
- how to find out how data packets are sent over the network?
- Create log files for later analysis
-- try getting data object that doesnt exist.
--- when interests arrive from application and when sent out?
--- when ccnd expects interests?

send frederik info about:
- config file location and syntax
- command line for each application
- can we modify times to ms?

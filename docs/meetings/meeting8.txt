Last week's action Items:
- Publish code on Google Code. (done)
- Send initial outline for feedback on contents. (sent initial copy)
- Complete the Response code. 
- Document setup and how ccnd handles interest and data responses plus any other observations (to decide what to expect from scenarios and if need to redesign).
- Document scenarios to be used in the experiment.
- Find out when would the thesis defense be. What to do if I can't make it by June? Is there another 'batch' following that?

Minutes:

- Interests are now sent manually. 
- Data response still not coded.
- Tested a 3 node setup with a (sender), b (relay), and c (receiver). Single interest packet propagated from A to C as expected.
- Using CCND_DEBUG=2 to track interest (to and from) messages 
- Identified other interests during registration/key publishing which we may need to disregard.
- Focus on ccnd Interest/data packet behavior for now.
- Once code is complete, use Haggle to simulate link breaks.


Action Items:
- Complete the Response code.
- Publish code on Google Code.
- Document setup and how ccnd handles interest and data responses plus any other observations (to decide what to expect from scenarios and if need to redesign).
- Document scenarios to be used in the experiment.
- Send initial report outline for feedback on contents.
- Find out when would the thesis defense be. What to do if I can't make it by June? Is there another 'batch' following that?

I. Abstract

II. Introduction 
 

III. Problem definition 
- What makes NDN useful in an ON? Is it a promising/rewarding alternative to conventional approaches? 
- What are the problems that face NDN in such a scenario/network configuration?
- Do the advantages outweight the shortcomings?
- What can be done to address these shortcomings?
 
- Additional issues (might move some to future/related work) 
-- identify issues related to device mobility in a ON 
-- sharing of information where connectivity is intermittent or not guaranteed
-- how caching (how much and for how long)can help optimize the retrieval and sharing process
-- routing optimization in an ON

- Thesis does not investigate:
-- Security (assume clear text, some overhead missing from calculations?)
-- Naming (assume basic naming scheme proposed/discussed in NDN paper; ie. ccnx:/org/data/file)

- What framework, methods and testbed are used in the investigation?
-- ccnx (as a ndn implementation), ON specific scenarios of varying complexities, Haggle

IV. Challenged Networks
- What they and why they are important to study?
-- These networks attempt to resolve problems that are not easily addressed with other widely deployed network architectures.
- Opportunistic Networks (used for this investigation)
- Delay Tolerant Networks
- Disruption Tolerant Networks
- Challenges and issues assosciated with such networks (move to dedicated section?)

V. Information Centric Networking
- How this model differs from the conventional approach.
-- A potential Paradigm shift. The location of the data is unimportant. Users interested in data, not its location. Information/data centric, not location centric.
-- Focuses on better content distribution, disruption and "flash-crowd" handling. 
-- Claimed advantages/strengths (scalable, cost efficient, persistent naming, object/data security, mobility, disruption tolerance, in-network caching)
- Prominent ICN based projects in EU/US
-- Publish/Subscribe models (PSIRP)
-- NetInf, Sail
-- DONA
-- CCN (Connect)
-- NDN (CCNx used as an implementation for this investigation)


VI. Challanges of Information Centric Networking on Challenged Networks
- Issues that need to be investigated/considered
-- Naming 
-- Name resolution (separate from naming?)
-- Routing
-- Caching
-- Scalability (Forwarding speed)
-- Error Control, Flow Control, and Congestion Management
-- Transport
-- Security (Encryption / trust, content protection) 
-- Privacy
-- Disruption tolerance
-- Network heterogeneity
-- Cost effectiveness / Compatibility
-- Performance
- What the thesis intends to experiment with
-- Disruption tolerance/robustness
-- Performance?
-- Scalability
-- Caching

VII. Investigation/Experimentation
- Brief CCNx description as NDN implementation (any assumptions that deviate from NDN design)
- Brief Haggle testbed description and why/how it's used.
- Outline experiments from simple to complex.
- Detailed description of scenarios
- Results - including measurements, graphs, calculations 
- Comparison with other solutions or conventional networks?

VIII.Discussion
- Were the results expected?
- Explain Why the results are the way they are.
- Proposals for improvement and their results.
- Proposals for future research/work.

IX. Conclusion

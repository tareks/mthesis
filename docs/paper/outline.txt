I. Abstract

II. Introduction (5 pages)
- Shortcomings associated with conventional TCP/IP architectures
-- Problems with handling delays, and transmission over high latency connections.
-- Data retrieval decoupling from location. Searching for data each host as opposed to data on the network (request/reply vs publish/retrieve).
- Background on challenged network architectures and how they can overcome these shortcomings.
-- Information sharing and retrieval where connectivity is intermittent or not guaranteed
- Named Data offers a different approach to for information retrieval
-- Information is retrieved by name rather than through a hosts, network caching is a by-product

Challenged Networks
- What they are and why they are important to study?
-- These architures attempt to resolve problems that are not easily addressed with other widely deployed network architectures, namely TCP/IP based.
- Opportunistic Networks
- Delay Tolerant Networks
- Disruption Tolerant Networks
- Challenges and issues assosciated with such networks (move to dedicated section?)
- Thesis focuses on ON(?) but results apply to delay and disruption tolerant networks as well.

Information Centric Networking
- How this model differs from the conventional approach.
-- A potential Paradigm shift. The location of the data is unimportant. Users interested in data, not its location. Information/data centric, not location centric.
-- Focuses on better content distribution, disruption and "flash-crowd" handling.
-- Claimed advantages/strengths (scalable, cost efficient, persistent naming, object/data security, mobility, disruption tolerance, in-network caching)
- Prominent ICN based projects in EU/US
-- Publish/Subscribe models (PSIRP)
-- NetInf, Sail
-- DONA
-- CCN (Connect)
-- NDN (CCNx used as an implementation for this investigation)
{ One sentence to describe each, and reference original paper - not too long }

Introduce challenges of Information Centric Networking on Challenged Networks
- Issues that need to be investigated/considered
-- Naming { not relevant }
-- Name resolution (separate from naming?) { not relevant }
-- Routing
-- Caching
-- Scalability (Forwarding speed)
-- Error Control, Flow Control, and Congestion Management { not relevant }
-- Transport
-- Security (Encryption / trust, content protection)
-- Privacy { not relevant }
-- Disruption tolerance
-- Network heterogeneity
-- Cost effectiveness / Compatibility
-- Performance
- What the thesis intends to experiment with { good enough for thesis }
-- Disruption tolerance/robustness { most important, covered by interest retransmission tests }
-- Caching { lightly inherently covered  }
-- Performance { vs TCP/IP in challenged environments }
-- Scalability { probably not covered, will be affected by addressing and routing issues - whole different area }

These challenges lead to problem definition

III. Problem definition (1-2 pages)
- What makes NDN useful in an ON? Is it a promising/rewarding alternative to conventional approaches?
- What are the problems that face NDN in such a scenario/network configuration?
- Do the advantages outweight the shortcomings?
- What can be done to address these shortcomings?

From general questions (how ICN useful in DTN setting), focus on the following:
- How do we design a game that works in a Challenged Network setting? Gaming platform as an example
-- How we came to understand CCNx and interest retransmission (from experiments)
contributions: experiments + design of gaming platform + evaluation of that platform
- main focus on disruption tolerance as an advantage of ICN

- Thesis does not investigate:
-- Security (assume clear text, minimal packet signature if any, some overhead missing from calculations as a result?)
-- Naming (assume basic naming scheme proposed/discussed in NDN paper; ie. ccnx:/org/data/file)
--- Flat addressing scheme from the node's point of view. Nodes ignore routing complexity and assume that data will get forwarded to the target nodes.

- What framework, methods and testbed are used in the investigation?
-- ccnx (as a ndn implementation)
-- Haggle (as a testbed)
-- ON specific scenarios of varying complexities (simply mainly to test interest retransmission in delay tolerant settings)
-- Delay Tolerant implementation of TicTacToe as an application


VII. Investigation/Experimentation (5-10 pages)
- Brief CCNx description as NDN implementation (any assumptions that deviate from NDN design)
- Brief Haggle testbed description and why/how it's used.
- Outline experiments from simple to complex.
-- Experiment 1 & 2 (done and documented)
-- Experiment 3 & 4 (documented but not run yet)
- Detailed description of scenarios
- Results - including measurements, graphs, calculations
- Implementation issues and challenges (related to timing and measurements)
- Comparison to conventional networks  (or satisfactory to compare vs scenarios with no disruption?)
- Discussion
-- Were the results expected?
-- Explain Why the results are the way they are.
-- Proposals for improvement and their results.
-- Proposals for future research/work.

VIII. Delay/Disruption Tolerant Gaming Platform (DTPG) - TicTacToe as an example (5-10 pages)
- Introduction
- Design alternatives
-- even ones with flaws that looked okay on paper
- Experimentation
-- Scenario 1: No network delays or disruptions
-- Scenario 2: Simulated link disruptions
- Discussion

IX. Related/Future Work (1 page)
- Additional issues to investigate
-- identify issues related to device mobility in a ON
--- Assumption made during investigation is that layer 1/2 connectivity is provided and nodes can communicate freely on top of those layers.
-- How caching (how much and for how long)can help optimize the retrieval and sharing process
-- Routing optimization in an ON (related to URI naming conventions and node discovery/bootstrapping)

All ccnd instances run on port 6001 for simplicity. ccnd instances are connected using UDP.
Applications may connect to their respective ccnd instances through UDP or TCP (shouldn't affect behavior on the network).

Also, outside this directory:
- Change ../scripts/upload_file_to_node.sh to ~/.ccnx/ so that it's picked up by ccnd on startup.
- Change ../scripts/collect_logs.sh to pulled the following log files:
-- ccnd.log : ccnd log with CCND_DEBUG=-1
-- ccn_log : application logging and output


Currently, warmup time allows for applications to start up. Must be close enough to avoid applications running before scenario starts.  


All .jar files are under /usr/local/haggle/ccnx/lib/

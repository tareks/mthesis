To Compile:
==========
edit 'env_setup' and configure CCNX_DIR and PROJ_DIR as needed.
run 'make'

Note: ant, make, javac need to be installed.


Instructions:
============
Note: env_setup handles the env vars needed to get things working, better to just use the run* scripts directly.

0) Make sure that ccnd is running on default (9695) port!
1) Create a test file
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=testfile bs=512 count=1
2) In one window, run the receiver node:
 ./runReceiver ccnx:/test/1 outfile
3) In another window, run the sender node:
./runSender ccnx:/test/1 testfile

Result:
------
outfile will get generated and be identical to testfile.
